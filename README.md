## Pros and Cons of TDD
### Pros
1. force the code to be more modular (small unit tests)
2. Many architectural problems would be considered in an early stage since the test are created in the first place
3. easier code maintainance and refactoration
4. provide clarity during implementation
5. provides early warning to design problems
6. creates an automated regression test suite

### Cons
1. Has to maintain the test suite
2. Tests may not be completely deterministic
3. Hard to create test beyond unit test level
4. hard to apply to existing legacy code
5. Have to perfom housekeeping continually. Elongate building time as test gow longer
6. Tedious to create the test (and create good test)
